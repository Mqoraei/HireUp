# HireUp – AI-Powered Initial Candidate Screening

**HireUp** is an AI-driven **pre‑interview screening system** designed to automate and enhance the **initial candidate assessment** process — before human interviews begin.  

This repository contains the **sanitized workflow export** of HireUp, implemented as a **state-machine orchestrated system** using **n8n**, powered by **LLMs**, and delivered through a **Telegram bot** for fast, low-friction validation.



## What Problem HireUp Solves

HR teams spend a disproportionate amount of time on early-stage screening:

- Reviewing large volumes of irrelevant or inflated résumés  
- Handling unstructured CV formats  
- Running repetitive, low-signal initial calls  

These pain points lead to **slow hiring**, **inefficient shortlisting**, and **HR fatigue**.  
HireUp focuses **exclusively** on removing this bottleneck.



## What HireUp Does

HireUp runs a **short, structured, time-bounded screening** between résumé collection and in-person interviews.

For each candidate, the system:

1. Collects the **target job role**  
2. Asks one **HR (behavioral/situational)** question  
3. Evaluates the HR response using an **LLM**  
4. Asks one **role-specific technical** question  
5. Evaluates the technical response  
6. Produces **explainable scores (1–10)** and a **decision-ready summary** for HR  





## Core Design Principles

- **State-machine driven:** deterministic flow, no skipped steps  
- **Time-controlled:** strict response windows with automatic timeouts  
- **Role-aware prompting:** questions adapt to the position applied for  
- **Explainable evaluation:** written analysis + numeric scoring  
- **Human-in-the-loop:** AI assists decisions, not replaces HR judgment
